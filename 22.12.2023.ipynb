    "Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together into a single unit (object), protecting internal data from unauthorized access and manipulation.\n",
    "## Inheritance:\n",
    "Creating new classes by inheriting features (attributes and methods) from existing classes, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "## Polymorphism:\n",
    "The ability of an object to take on different forms and respond differently to the same message depending on its actual type. This allows for flexible and adaptable code.\n",
    "These four pillars form the foundation of OOP and contribute to its benefits of modularity, code reusability, maintainability, and scalability."

    "\n",
    "\"self\" refers to the specific object the method is currently acting upon. This distinguishes it from local variables within the method, which are specific to that execution.\n",
    "Without \"self,\" you wouldn't have a way to differentiate between attributes and parameters within the method.\n",
    "## 2. Accessing Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"self\" acts as a bridge between the method and the object's attributes and methods.\n",
    "By using \"self.attribute,\" you access the specified attribute within the current object. Similarly, \"self.method()\" calls a method on the current object.\n",
    "## 3. Maintaining Identity and State:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"self\" ensures that modifications made within the method affect the specific object, not a generic copy.\n",
    "This preserves the individual object's state and identity throughout its lifecycle.\n",
    "## 4. Code Readability and Clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly using \"self\" makes the code clearer and easier to understand, especially for complex methods that interact with the object's internals.\n",
    "It highlights the relationship between the method and the object, preventing unintentional modifications to unrelated data."
